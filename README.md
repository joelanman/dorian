A project to show user journeys using screen captures from automated builds.

## User needs

- As a Service team member

  - I need to easily see full journey flows on my service

    So I can discuss it with other members of the team

  - I need to see how the service looked on a certain date

    So I can discuss it with other members of the team

  So I can evaluate how appropriate the design solution is to my service, and to maintain consistency
